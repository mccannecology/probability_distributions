# Interactive Probability Distributions 

This repo contains the files for generating an interactive document containing probability distributions. The repo consists of an individual `.R` script for each distribution and a R Markdown file (`probability_distributions_shiny.Rmd`) that calls all of these scripts into a single document.

For each probability distribution, there is a plot for a random sample, the probability density, the cumulative density, and a quantile plot.
